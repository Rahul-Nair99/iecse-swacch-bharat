### Cleaning up e-waste

Plastics, chemical effluents and other mainstream pollutants grab the headlines, but a significant yet neglected type of waste/pollutant 
isnt talked about as much - 
**E-Waste**

_Discarded batteries, mobile phones, electronic devices_ etc make up millions of tonnes of waste and are one of the most harmful pollutants
given that their components are made of toxic compounds which when exposed to the nature can bring about some rather horrifying effects.

#### Ways to combat e-waste

_We've all heard of the 3 Rs_

1. Recycling dead components

Most of us dont bother to find the right place to recycle our e-waste and just discard it to our convenience. Hence we need major efforts from 
the govt or private companies to make e-waste recycling convenient enough that people would adopt it on a large scale

[E Parisaara](http://ewasteindia.com/) , India's first authorized e waste recycler, aims to take this initiative forward.

2. Reusing aged components

While the wider public may not have knowledge of how to integrate certain parts of aging devices into new ones, they could donate those 
devices to certain companies that gather reusable **TBC**
